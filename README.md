# DynamoMEP

DynamoMEP is a Dynamo package for working with MEP elements in Revit 2016 and Dynamo 0.9.

DynamoMEP is an Open-Source project available on github and Dynamoâ€™s package manager. The package only contains nodes from creating room and MEP Spaces, and will be improved over time.

The project is being developed in C# using Visual Studio, and will work with Dynamo 0.9.0, and Revit 2016. The project consists of a zero-touch library containing the nodes.

##Nodes

Here is a short description of the existing nodes:

* ByPointAndLevel(Point,Level): Create a room from its location point and level and place it in the project.
* FromElement(Element): Retrieve a room from an existing one. Use a Dynamo Revit element as input.

####Get metadata
* GetIdentificationData(): Retrieve room name and number

####Get informations
* BoundaryElements: Retrieve the room boundary elements (walls, column and boundary lines).
* Level: Retrieve the room's level.
* LocationPoint: Retrieve the room's location as a Dynamo point.
* Windows: Retrieve windows in this room
* Doors: Retrieve doors in this room


###Space

####Create a MEP Space
* ByPoint(Point): Create a space from its location point and place it on the nearest level.
* ByPointAndLevel(Point,Level): Create a space from its location point and level and place it in the project.
* FromElement(Element) : Retrieve a space from an existing one. Use a Dynamo Revit element as input.

####Get metadata
* GetIdentificationData(): Retrieve space name and number, along with the name and number of the corresponding room.

####Get informations
* BoundaryElements: Retrieve the space boundary elements (walls, column and boundary lines).
* Level: Retrieve the space's level.
* LocationPoint: Retrieve the space's location as a Dynamo point.
